# House_price_prediction

In this project I have used House-price-prediction dataset to predict price of House based on user inputs

In this I have used Pandas for Data cleaning and Data manipulation.

In this I have used Matplotlib for Ploting.

I have used Linear Regression , Decision tree, Random forest, Gradient boosting and XGBoost for predicting result.

My models produced R square for Linear Regression : 0.65, Decision tree : 0.5, Random forest: 0.71, Gradient boosting: 0.71, XGBoost : 0.7
